# moving-average-crossover-backtester
This project implements and backtests a **Moving Average Crossover** trading strategy for Bitcoin (**BTC-USD**).   It downloads historical price data, applies a trading rule based on two simple moving averages (SMA), compares the results with a **buy-and-hold** benchmark, and generates visual performance reports.
